# Facade Pattern

The goal of the Facade pattern is to provide an entry point for functions that are too complex to be handled separately.

I suppose this can also be used when we want to create more meaningful higher-level functions as well.

In the example, the ProductInstaller class provides an entry point for installing a product, preventing the client from having to manage the lower-level classes that need to work together to achieve this goal.
