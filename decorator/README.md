# Decorator Pattern

This pattern uses composition instead of inheritance to extend the functionality of an existing class.

In the example code, we have a UserServiceV2, which extends the functionality of UserService and changes the behaviour of a specific function.
UserServiceV2 can be used in any place UserService is used, according to our needs.

This example does not seem complicated enough to ask for a pattern like that.
It was chosen only to demonstrate how to apply the pattern.
